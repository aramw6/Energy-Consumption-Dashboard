# Energy-Consumption-Dashboard

This Power BI dashboard visualizes energy consumption data (water, electricity, and gas) across various buildings in different countries.
It provides insights into usage trends, anomalies, and cost-effectiveness metrics to help streamline operations and reduce inefficiencies. 
The dashboard includes dedicated pages for each energy type, as well as a centralized overview for strategic decision-making.

# Problem Statement:

Our company supplies energy (water, electricity, and gas) to various buildings across multiple countries. 
Without a centralized system to track and analyze energy usage, identifying trends and 
optimizing operations has been difficult, leading to inefficiencies, increased costs, and potential service disruptions.

#My Approach:

Created dedicated pages for each energy type (water, electricity, gas) in Power BI.
Provided detailed insights into consumption patterns, anomalies, and cost-effectiveness metrics for each energy source.
Developed a centralized dashboard that summarizes key metrics across all energy types for an efficient overview.

#Process Involved:

- Power Query: Used to clean and transform raw data for analysis.
- Data Modeling: Connected tables and defined relationships in Power BI.
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Created measures for tracking KPIs like cost-efficiency and consumption anomalies.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted to identify patterns and generate actionable insights.
- Visualization: Designed interactive and dynamic visualizations for easy navigation and understanding of energy consumption.

#Features:

- Separate dashboards for water, electricity, and gas, each showing detailed consumption data.
- Centralized view of overall energy consumption trends across all sources.
- Dynamic visualizations with the ability to filter by energy type, location, and time period.
- Key metrics including peak usage hours, cost estimations, and anomalies detection.
